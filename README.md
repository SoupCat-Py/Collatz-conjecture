All three of the programs do roughly the same thing. <br />
v1 was made like at midnight so it's not very good. <br />
v2 is just a re-written version of v1 with more code that is more compact and easier to understand <br />
v3 is a complete rework of the whole thing that includes a GUI and can graph the actual sequence! <br />

*You will need to install PySimpleGUI and matplotlib to run the .py of v3*

I have also included a build of version 3 - however you will still need a PySimpleGUI developer licence, but there is a free trial for 31 days
